        Question: 'What is the default state in a Redux reducer?',
        Option1: 'The initial state value before any actions are dispatched',
        Option2: 'The state after an action is processed',
        Option3: 'The current state of the application',
        Option4: 'The state managed by React components'
      },
      {
        Question: 'How does Redux help in large-scale applications?',
        Option1: 'By providing a predictable and centralized state management system',

        Option3: 'Redux is built into React, while Context API is external',
        Option4: 'Context API is used for backend development, while Redux is for frontend'
